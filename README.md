# 30DayChartChallenge


## About

Taken directly from the [30DayChartChallenge](https://30daychartchallenge.org/about/) website: 

> The #30DayChartChallenge is a community-driven challenge that happens each year during April. Every day, there is a certain prompt, grouped into five categories: comparisons, distributions, relationships, time series, and uncertainties. Anyone is welcome to contribute, no matter which data source or tool is used to create the visualizations.

>The first edition was run in 2021 with 1,960 contributions from all over the world. The challenge is inspired by the #30DayMapChallenge which was initiated by Topi Tjukanov in 2019.
